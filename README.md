## Why PhantomJS for Raspberry Pi ?

I use Raspberry Pi as a testing machine for any server applications like web scraping. But there were no PhantomJS binaries for armhf architecture on the web. So I built it.

Since the build spend me a lot of time, I think someone else also need it. So I share it.

## PhantomJS Versions
